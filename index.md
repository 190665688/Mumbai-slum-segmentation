# Mumbai slum segmentation

(Stress on AI 4 social good)

Add an intro (gives reader quick idea on what you have done, go into detail after talking about slums and giving slum facts) 

More than one billion people live in slums around the world. In some developing countries, slum residents make up for more than half of the population and lack reliable sanitation services, clean water, electricity, other basic services. We wanted to help. We built a deep learning model to map and

## What are slums?

The United Nations Habitat program defines slums as informal settlements that lack one or more of the following five conditions: access to clean water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area that is not overcrowded, durable housing and secure tenure.

## Mumbai Slums

Mumbai is one of the most populous cities in India, and while it is one of the wealthiest cities in India, it is also home to some of the worldâ€™s biggest slums -- Dharavi, Mankhurd-Govandi belt, Kurla-Ghatkopar belt, Dindoshi and The Bhandup-Mulund slums. The number of slum-dwellers in Mumbai is estimated to be around 9 million, up from 6 million in 2001 that is, 62% of of Mumbai live in informal slums.

(add one crude infographic of mumbai with markers of each slum?)

The situation is pretty bad in Mumbai. These pictures only capture a fraction of ... 

We wanted to help. 


## What did we do?

*slum
rehabilitation is an important global challenge, and a significant
amount of effort and resources have been put into this endeavor*.  These initiatives
rely heavily on **slum mapping** and **monitoring**. Unfortunatrly, when we spoke to the concenred authorities, they did not have any automated system ... . 
We introduce an approach to **segment and map individual slums from
satellite imagery**, leveraging regional convolutional neural networks for instance
segmentation using transfer learning. In addition, we also introduce a method to
**perform change detection and monitor slum change over time**. --> rephrase and make more like blog writing


## How did we go about it?

We curated a dataset from Google Earth and with data from the Slum Rehalibiliation Authority of Mumbai. We trained a Deep Learning model for instance segmentation (Mask R-CNN) on this dataset and

## How can you help?

Very good section.
