# Mumbai slum segmentation

More than one billion people live in slums around the world. In some developing
countries, slum residents make up for more than half of the population and lack
reliable sanitation services, clean water, electricity, other basic services. We wanted to help. We built a deep learning model to map and and monitor slum growth over time.
