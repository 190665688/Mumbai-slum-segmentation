# Mumbai slum segmentation

(Stress on AI 4 social good)

More than one billion people live in slums around the world. In some developing
countries, slum residents make up for more than half of the population and lack
reliable sanitation services, clean water, electricity, other basic services.

## Mumbai Slums

Mumbai is the most populous city .. .However, it is also, home to some of the largest slums in asia - Dharavi, Govandi ..

Add pictues at 1000m of each slum ( add a population stat on the pic itself)
(add one crude infographic of mumbai with markers of each slum?)

The situation is pretty bad in Mumbai. 


*slum
rehabilitation is an important global challenge, and a significant
amount of effort and resources have been put into this endeavor*.  These initiatives
rely heavily on **slum mapping** and **monitoring**. Unfortunatrly, when we spoke to the concenred authorities, they did not have any automated system ... . 

We wanted to help.


## What did we do to help?

We introduce an approach to **segment and map individual slums from
satellite imagery**, leveraging regional convolutional neural networks for instance
segmentation using transfer learning. In addition, we also introduce a method to
**perform change detection and monitor slum change over time**. --> rephrase and make more like blog writing


## How did we go about it?

We curated a dataset from Google Earth and with data from the Slum Rehalibiliation Authority of Mumbai. We trained a Deep Learning model for instance segmentation (Mask R-CNN) on this dataset and
