# Mumbai slum segmentation

(Stress on AI 4 social good)

More than one billion people live in slums around the world. In some developing
countries, slum residents make up for more than half of the population and lack
reliable sanitation services, clean water, electricity, other basic services. Thus, slum
rehabilitation is an important global challenge, and a significant
amount of effort and resources have been put into this endeavor. These initiatives
rely heavily on **slum mapping** and **monitoring**.

In this work, we introduce an approach to **segment and map individual slums from
satellite imagery**, leveraging regional convolutional neural networks for instance
segmentation using transfer learning. In addition, we also introduce a method to
**perform change detection and monitor slum change over time**.
